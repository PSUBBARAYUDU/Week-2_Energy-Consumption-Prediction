## 📂 File Descriptions

### `data_preprocessing.py`
Handles cleaning, transformation, and preparation of raw energy data.  
Includes steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting data into training/testing sets.

### `model_training.py`
Trains machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) on the preprocessed data.  
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as **RMSE** and **R² score**.

### `prediction.py`
Uses the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.  
Outputs predicted energy consumption values for given input features.

### `visualization.py`
Generates visual insights such as **actual vs predicted plots**, **correlation heatmaps**, and **trend charts**.  
Helps in understanding model behavior and energy consumption trends visually.

### `README`
Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, dependencies, and usage guidelines.
